    documentation="digital identities that John and Jane have at the mentioned organizations are recorded in the ICT systems in the form of “accounts”, and given what we’ve defined for digital identities as abstract concepts, the definition of the more concrete concept “account” is relatively easy:&#xD;&#xA;Account:&#xD;&#xA;The unique technical representation of a digital identity within an information system context, which contains at a minimum those identity attributes that are both relevant to all information systems within that context, and correspond to the represented digital identity.&#xD;&#xA;When creating a model for an Account, this definition can guide us in several ways. Since the Account is a technical representation of something that we’ve modelled as a Business object, it stands to reason that Account is a Data object, and it’s related to Digital identity by means of the realization relation. And since the account must “contain” the values of the identity attributes of the Digital identity, it must be composed of a number of “Account attributes”, some of which must realize all the different (relevant) identity attributes that define the Digital identity."/>

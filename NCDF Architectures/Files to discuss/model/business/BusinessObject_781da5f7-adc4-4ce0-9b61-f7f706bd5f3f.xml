    documentation="NIST special publication 800-63-3 (Grassi, Garcia, &amp; Fenton, 2017) provides this definition: “Identity: An attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describe a subject within a given context”. Elsewhere, it says “[a] digital identity is the unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction. A digital identity is always unique in the context of a digital service, but does not necessarily need to uniquely identify the subject in all contexts.”&#xD;&#xA;Windley (2008) has something similar to say: “A digital identity contains data that uniquely describes a person or thing (called the subject or entity in the language of digital identity) but also contains information about the subject’s relationships to other entities.”&#xD;&#xA;Ben Ayed (2014) shows that “Thus, identity is defined as a collection of data about subject that represent attributes, preferences, and traits, so in parallel, in the digital world a person’s identity is typically referred to as their digital identity.”&#xD;&#xA;We can combine the definitions and observations from these sources to obtain a workable definition:&#xD;&#xA;Digital identity:&#xD;&#xA;A unique representation of a subject interacting with digital services. It entails data (an identity attribute, or set thereof) which uniquely describes that subject within a given context (although it needn’t uniquely describe that subject in all contexts)."/>

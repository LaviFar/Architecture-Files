    documentation="The definition of the NCDF information exchnage specification is missed (what we currently are doing with the tool &quot;MessageBuilder&quot;). I think that here we consider the map process as a more general process where also the NCDF information selection and the NCDF message design happen. Suggest to make the concepts explicit."/>

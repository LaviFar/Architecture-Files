Post CWIX 2021 Analysis
 Request to analyze artifacts
 Sessions run by Germany, analyzing the artifacts...
  Map COI item to the Semantic Reference Model?
  How it was done?
  Rytis - We should have a workshop on how to do a mapping (to SRM, etc)
  Mark - This should be done, also some idea about what the business process is...
  Nico - Raises point -> what we did at CWIX, was prototype activity, not ideal. We should try to separate the prototype from how it should be in the future.
  Rytis - which domains? which examples?
  Mark - recommend - Medical and CBRN
  Rytis - Artifacts:
          1. How to do mapping
          2. Mapping tables
          3. Mapped artifacts
  NICO - what is the goal of this workshop?  Medical workshop, would focus on Medical mappings... but not useful to review last year's XSLT documents?
  Vincenzo - We should be talking about process - example, what if we need to introduce an extension to an entity in the SRM?
  Nico - Agreed
  <discussion>
  Rytis - Is there an artifact describing process? Overall enterprise process for NCDF?
  Phil - We have been thinking of those in the past, but not able to find them
  Rytis - Need follow up to CWIX, and need to investigate this process question

Action Item: Build out (C2, C4) with identification of key processes
             How to maintain artifacts developed in exercises?
             How to document the process?
